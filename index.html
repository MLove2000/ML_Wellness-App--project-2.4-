    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I created an App for improving mental health. Specifically retraining your brain to think more positively. The purpose of the app is to encourage self love, confidence, and positive thinking. The user does this by participating in daily activities in the app. the app tracks progress through mood and timing on the activity. Each activity is ten minutes. The users mood is asked before and after the activity.</p>

    <h2>Target User</h2>
    <p>My target audience would be anyone who is struggling with negative thoughts, depression, or needs more confidence in themselves. It's easy to use so you can use it whenever and where ever. There's no age limit since anyone can struggle with these problems.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>During my researching process, I downloaded a couple apps to help see what I wanted to use. I wanted to make sure the app would be easy to use and understandable to new users. Some apps I used to achieve this were Headspace: Mindful Meditation and InnerHour: Self-care therapy.
  </p>

<h2>User Interviews</h2>
    <p>I got some good useful points in the User Interviews. Most were small details but very helpful. It helped me narrow a lot of things down as well. I had a lot of ideas and the interview helped guide me into one direction.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Some challenges I had during this project were getting too carried away, staying on a specific track, space, and changes. I made a lot of changes because I had a set goal but wasn't sure how to get exactly where I wanted to be. The concept itself was a bit of a challenge. I was able to get past these with help from the user interviews and researching other wellness apps.</p>

<h2>Successes</h2>
<p>Some successes I had during this project were making it easy to use, consistent, and understandable. Testability seemed really easy to use and there weren't many questions but a lot of helpful suggestions. I had a ton of ideas to start from as well so I already had a good place to start from.</p>
